This package contains the code used in the calculations for
our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.9630)
on the optimization of the two-stage group sequential three-arm gold-standard
design for non-inferiority trials.

It allows for the simultaneous optimization of the
allocation ratios for both stages (in two-stage designs),
the efficacy boundaries, and the
futility boundaries. The optimization is performed
under type I and II error constraints and the objective function is
customizable by the user.
Methods to optimize two- and one-stage designs are available.

# Installation
You can install the CRAN version of this package by typing the following
command into your R console:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("OptimalGoldstandardDesigns")
```

You can install the GitHub Version by typing:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("jan-imbi/OptimalGoldstandardDesigns")
```

You can also [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
directly from github. This will
give you access to the /data/ subdirectory, which contains code to reproduce
the examples from the paper.

# Documentation
You can check out an online version of the documentation 
[using this link.](https://jan-imbi.github.io/OptimalGoldstandardDesigns/).
In particular, you might be interested in reading the [*Usage guidance* article](https://jan-imbi.github.io/OptimalGoldstandardDesigns/articles/Introduction.html).

# Example
## A one-stage desgin
```{r}
library(OptimalGoldstandardDesigns)
optimize_design_onestage(
  alpha = .025,
  beta = .2,
  alternative_TP = .4,
  alternative_TC = 0,
  Delta = .2,
  print_progress = FALSE
)
```

## A two-stage design
```{r}
optimize_design_twostage(
  beta = 0.2,
  alternative_TP = 0.4,
  alternative_TC = 0,
  Delta = 0.2,
  print_progress = FALSE,
  binding_futility = TRUE
)
```
