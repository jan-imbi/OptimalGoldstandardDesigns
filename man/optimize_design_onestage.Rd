\description{
Calculate optimal design parameters for a single-stage gold-standard design
}
\details{
This function calculates optimal design parameters for a two-stage three-arm gold-standard
non-inferiority trial. Run \code{vignette("mathematical_details", package = "OptimalGoldstandardDesigns")}
to see details about the test statistics and testing procedure corresponding to this design.


Parameters which can be optimized are the allocation ratios for all groups and stages and the
futility and efficacy boundaries of the first stage. The allocation ratios are
cT2 = nT2 / nT1, cP1 = nP1 / nT1,
cP2 = nP2 / nT1, cC1 = nC1 / nT1 and cC2 = nC2 / nT1. Here, nT1 denotes the sample size
of the treatment group in the first stage, nP2 the sample size of the placebo group in the
second stage, etc. The first stage efficacy boundaries are bTP1e for the treatment vs
placebo testing problem, and bTC1e for the treatment vs control non-inferiority testing
problem. The futility boundaries are denoted by bTP1f and bTC1f.

If these parameters are left unspecified or set to NULL, they will be included into the
optimization process, otherwise they will be considered boundary constraints.
You may also supply quoted expressions as arguments for these
parameters to solve a constrained optimization problem. For example, you can supply
\code{cT2 = 1, cP2 = quote(cP1), cC2 = quote(cC1)} to ensure that the first and second
stage allocation ratios are equal.


The design is optimized with respect to the objective criterion given by the parameter
\code{objective}. By default, ...

Designs are calculated to fulfill the following constraints: the family-wise type I error
rate is controlled at \code{alpha} under any combination of the two null hypotheses
\code{muT - muP = 0} and \code{muT - muC + Delta = 0}.
The power to reject both hypothesis given both alternative
hypotheses \code{muT - muP = alternative_TP} and \code{muT - muC + Delta = alternative_TC + Delta}
is at least \code{1 - beta}. Variances are assumed to be given by \code{varT, varP} and \code{varC}.

If \code{binding_futility} is \code{TRUE}, type I error recycling is used.
If \code{always_both_futility_tests} is \code{TRUE}, it is assumed that futility tests for both
hypotheses are performed at interim, regardless of whether the treatment vs placebo null hypothesis
was successfully rejected. If \code{always_both_futility_tests} is \code{FALSE}, the futility
test for the treatment vs. control testing problem only needs to be done if the null for the
treatment vs. placebo testing problem was rejected in the first stage.
