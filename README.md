This package contains the code used in the calculations for our
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.9630) on the optimization of the
two-stage group sequential three-arm gold-standard design for
non-inferiority trials.

It allows for the simultaneous optimization of the allocation ratios for
both stages (in two-stage designs), the efficacy boundaries, and the
futility boundaries. The optimization is performed under type I and II
error constraints and the objective function is customizable by the
user. Methods to optimize two- and one-stage designs are available.

# Installation

You can install the CRAN version of this package by typing the following
command into your R console:

``` r
install.packages("OptimalGoldstandardDesigns")
```

You can install the GitHub Version by typing:

``` r
remotes::install_github("jan-imbi/OptimalGoldstandardDesigns")
```

You can also [clone this
repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
directly from github. This will give you access to the /data/
subdirectory, which contains code to reproduce the examples from the
paper.

# Documentation

You can check out an online version of the documentation [using this
link.](https://jan-imbi.github.io/OptimalGoldstandardDesigns/). In
particular, you might be interested in reading the [*Usage guidance*
article](https://jan-imbi.github.io/OptimalGoldstandardDesigns/articles/Introduction.html).

# Example

## A one-stage desgin

``` r
library(OptimalGoldstandardDesigns)
optimize_design_onestage(
  alpha = .025,
  beta = .2,
  alternative_TP = .4,
  alternative_TC = 0,
  Delta = .2,
  print_progress = FALSE
)
#> Sample sizes (stage 1): T: 413, P: 125, C: 404
#> Efficacy boundaries (stage 1): Z_TP_e: 1.95996, Z_TC_e: 1.95996
#> Maximum overall sample size: 942
#> Placebo penalty at optimum (kappa * nP): 0.0
#> Objective function value: 942.0
#> Type I error for TP testing: 2.5%
#> Type I error for TC testing: 2.5%
#> Power: 80.2%
```

## A two-stage design

``` r
optimize_design_twostage(
  beta = 0.2,
  alternative_TP = 0.4,
  alternative_TC = 0,
  Delta = 0.2,
  print_progress = FALSE,
  binding_futility = TRUE
)

#> Efficacy boundaries (stage 2): Z_TP_e: 2.40505, Z_TC_e: 2.04331
#> Inverse normal combination test weights (TP): w1: 0.68710, w2: 0.72656
#> Inverse normal combination test weights (TC): w1: 0.72466, w2: 0.68911
#> Maximum overall sample size: 1073
#> Expected sample size (H1): 768.5
#> Expected sample size (H0): 619.9
#> Expected placebo group sample size (H1): 100.2
#> Expected placebo group sample size (H0): 103.5
#> Objective function value: 768.5
#> (local) type I error for TP testing: 2.50%
#> (local) type I error for TC testing: 2.50%
#> Probability of futility stop (H1): 8.33%
#> Probability of futility stop (H0): 86.28%
